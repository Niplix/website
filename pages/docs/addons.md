# Recommended Addons

## uBlock Origin tweaks

[uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) comes bundled with LibreWolf. Also see their [wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki). We'll mention a few filter lists and entry points to the uBlock wiki.

Some essential uBlock Wiki pages to understand how uBlock Origin works:

- Easy mode, the default mode that we ship with the browser -> [Blocking mode:easy-mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-easy-mode).
- Dynamic filtering, suggested for enhanced protection -> [Dynamic filtering:quick guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide).
- Medium mode, suggested for enhanced protection, might require to fix some websites manually -> [Blocking mode:medium-mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode).

**Filter lists:**

- uBlock wiki: [Filter lists](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists-from-around-the-web): The uBlock wiki page on filter lists.
- [adblock nocoin list](https://github.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list): Good blocklist against crypto-mining.
- A collection of filter lists that are available on filterlists.com: [see this disussion page](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt).

We list two JavaScript blocking add-ons below, NoScript and uMatrix, but uBlock itself also has a JavaScript blocking option. More about that on this [wiki page](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Per-site-switches#no-scripting).

## Recommended Addons

- [uMatrix](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/): Note: uMatrix development has recently been restarted, and it does give _more control_ over what gets blocked than NoScript, either uMatrix or NoScript are good choices.
