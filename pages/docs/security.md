# Report a Security Issue

If you want to report a security issue, open a new issue on a one of our
[GitLab repositories](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser) (for
example on the windows repo a issue for the Windows build).

When creating a new issue, be sure to check the `This issue is confidential`
box. You can read more about that
[here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html).
