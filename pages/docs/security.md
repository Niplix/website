# Report a Security Issue

If you want to report a security issue, open
a new issue on any of our [GitLab repositories](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser).
When creating a new issue, be sure to check the
box "`This issue is confidential and should only be visible to team members with at least Reporter access.`"
