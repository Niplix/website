# Browser Tests

There are several good browser testing sites on the Internet. Here are just a
few that we find most useful. We're always open for tips on new good ones.

## Security/Fingerprint

- EFF's [Cover Your Tracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/)
- Arkenfox's [TorZillaPrint](https://arkenfox.github.io/TZP/index.html)
- [browserleaks.com](https://browserleaks.com/)
- [Device Info](https://www.deviceinfo.me/)
- Client side [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html)

These tests are not intended to be used as oracles, but rather as a way to check
your setup and verify that your changes are applied.

## Performance

Performance tests can be done with [Octane](https://chromium.github.io/octane/).
It needs to be launched with other applications closed and with no other
activity. It is recommended to run the test multiple times and then calculate
the average.
