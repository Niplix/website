There is a repository available for Debian Unstable. Librewolf
can either be installed using the .deb file or by adding the
repo as explained on the

page.

  **Note** This is for Debian Unstable only - do not try to install this package
  on any other branch of Debian or Ubuntu/Mint, or you will have errors about
  being unable to resolve the dependencies.
