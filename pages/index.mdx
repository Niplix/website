## What is LibreWolf?

This project is an custom and independent version of Firefox, with the primary
goals of privacy, security and user freedom.

LibreWolf is designed to increase protection against tracking and fingerprinting
techniques, while also including a few security improvements. This is achieved
through our privacy and security oriented settings and patches. LibreWolf also
aims to remove all the telemetry, data collection and annoyances, as well as
disabling anti-freedom features like DRM.
