## What is LibreWolf?

This project is an independent “fork” of Firefox, with the
primary goals of privacy security and user freedom. It is
the community run successor to LibreFox

LibreWolf is designed to minimize data collection and
telemetry as much as possible. This is achieved through
hundreds of privacy/security/performance settings and patches.
Intrusive integrated addons including updater, crashreporter,
and pocket are removed too.

**LibreWolf is NOT associated with Mozilla or its products.**
