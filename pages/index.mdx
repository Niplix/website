## What is LibreWolf?

This project is an independent “fork” of Firefox, with the primary goals of
privacy security and user freedom. It is the community run successor to LibreFox

LibreWolf is designed to minimize data collection and telemetry as much as
possible. This is achieved through hundreds of privacy/security/performance
settings and patches. Intrusive integrated addons including updater,
crashreporter, and pocket are removed too.
