# Installation instructions

<ChangeOs />

To install LibreWolf on any other Linux Distribution, you have three options

### AppImage

<DownloadButton />

Then run `chmod +x LibreWolf-*.AppImage` to make it executable. To install LibreWolf permanently via an AppImage,
we recommend something like [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher).

#### Updating

AppImage files are now released as gitlab packages as well at
https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/appimage/-/packages.
This allows having stable links (at `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/24386000/packages/generic/librewolf/latest/$FILE_NAME`)`
which can be used as update information for the AppImage releases.

This means that from this release onward, AppImage releases can be updated with `AppImageUpdater`.

A release downloaded as `LibreWolf.x86_64.AppImage`, for example, can be
updated with `./AppImageUpdate-x86_64.AppImage -d ./LibreWolf.x86_64.AppImage`.

### Flatpak

To install [from Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.gitlab.librewolf-community):

```bash
flatpak install flathub io.gitlab.librewolf-community
```

To run:

```bash
flatpak run io.gitlab.librewolf-community
```

Check out [Set up Flatpak](https://www.flatpak.org/setup/) to find out how to prepare flatpak to use on your distribution.

### Compiling from source

Compiling from source is possible for most versions of LibreWolf,
just head over to the relevant repository, clone it, and read the
README.md. As LibreWolf is a community effort, people are trying
out different things in different browser repositories. In general
tho, most of the compilation issues come from creating the build
environment, the actual compilation process by Firefox is standard
and relatively straightforward.
