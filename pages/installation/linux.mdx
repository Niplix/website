To install LibreWolf on any other Linux Distribution, you have three options

## AppImage

<DownloadButton />

### Installing

To install LibreWolf permanently via an AppImage, we recommend
[AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher).

With AppImageLauncher installed, you just need to open the AppImage with
AppImageLauncher and click `Integrate and run`. LibreWolf should then be
permanently installed on your system and launchable via the application menu.

### Updating or Uninstalling

To update or uninstall LibreWolf from your system, you can just right click the
LibreWolf application menu entry and click either `Remove AppImage from system`
or `Update AppImage`.

After pressing the update button, the whole update process will be completely
automatic and you don't have to do anything else.

## Compiling from source

Compiling from source is possible for most versions of LibreWolf, just head over
to the [linux repository](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/linux).
As LibreWolf is a community effort, people are trying out different things in
different browser repositories. In general tho, most of the compilation issues
come from creating the build environment, the actual compilation process by
Firefox is standard and relatively straightforward.
