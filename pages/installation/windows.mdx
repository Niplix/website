### Installer

To install LibreWolf on Windows, just download and run the latest installer

<DownloadButton />

If you don't have it already, you probably also need the
[Visual C++ Runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-160#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022).

To update LibreWolf when a new version is released, just install the new
`setup.exe`.

### Chocolatey

Alternatively you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to download and keep LibreWolf up to date. After installing Chocolatey, just run:

```
choco install librewolf
```
