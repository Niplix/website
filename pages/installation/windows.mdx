## Installer

To install LibreWolf on Windows, just download and run the latest installer

<GitlabDownloadButton id="winDownloadSetup" />

This won't update LibreWolf automatically. When a new version is released, you
have to manually install the new `setup.exe` again.  
If you want to get updates automatically, take a look at the **unofficial**
[LibreWolf WinUpdater](https://codeberg.org/ltguillaume/librewolf-winupdater),
which accomplishes this via a scheduled task.  
If you just want to get notified when a new version is released, you can get the
**unofficial**
[LibreWolf Updater extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/librewolf-updater/).

Currently we also release a portable version of LibreWolf, useful in cases where
installation at system level is not possible, or for just testing some aspect of
LibreWolf. LibreWolf WinUpdater is included for automatic updates. You can
dowload it here:

<GitlabDownloadButton id="winDownloadPortable" />

## Microsoft Store

We are currently testing distribution on Windows via the Microsoft Store. This
has the main advantage that updates are provided automatically. You can read
more about the ongoing process in
[this issue](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/issues/108)
and download LibreWolf from the Microsoft Store here:

<Button
