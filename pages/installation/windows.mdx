## Installer

To install LibreWolf on Windows, just download and run the latest installer

<DownloadButton />

If you don't have it already, you probably also need the
[Visual C++ Runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-160#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022).

To update LibreWolf when a new version is released, just install the new
`setup.exe`.

Currently we also release a portable version of LibreWolf, useful in cases where installation at system level is not possible, or for just testing some aspect of LibreWolf. It's also found on the [releases page](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/-/releases).

## Package Managers

Alternatively you can use a package manager to download LibreWolf and keep it up to
date. 

### With [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

```
choco install librewolf
```

To see the current status of the Chocolatey package, you can visit the [LibreWolf chocolatey page](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/librewolf).

### With [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli)

```
winget install librewolf
```

The winget command line tool is only supported on Windows 10 1709 (build 16299) or later at this time. Using winget is explained in [this Microsft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#production-recommended).
