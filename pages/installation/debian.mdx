## Debian 11, Ubuntu 20 and Mint 20

For Debian 11, Ubuntu 20 and Mint 20, we now have a Debian repository with which
you can easily install and update LibreWolf. To add it to your system and
install LibreWolf, run the following commands one by one:

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://deb.librewolf.net $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/librewolf.list

sudo wget http://deb.librewolf.net/keyring.gpg -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/librewolf.gpg

sudo apt update

sudo apt install librewolf -y
```

Alternatively, you can download the `.deb` files of these builds directly from
[fresh.librewolf.io](https://fresh.librewolf.io/).

## Debian Unstable

There also is a independent repository available for Debian Unstable. You can
add it to your system and install LibreWolf by the following commands:

```bash
echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/bgstack15:/aftermozilla/Debian_Unstable/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/home:bgstack15:aftermozilla.list

curl -fsSL https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:bgstack15:aftermozilla/Debian_Unstable/Release.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/home_bgstack15_aftermozilla.gpg > /dev/null

sudo apt update

sudo apt install librewolf -y
```

You can also download the `.deb` files of these builds directly from the
[Open Build Service](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/bgstack15:/aftermozilla/Debian_Unstable/amd64/).

## Other Debian based distributions

You can try installing the Ubuntu 20 build from the deb.librewolf.net repository
by running the following commands.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://deb.librewolf.net focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/librewolf.list

sudo wget http://deb.librewolf.net/keyring.gpg -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/librewolf.gpg

sudo apt update

sudo apt install librewolf -y
```

This may or may not work, depending on how close your distribution is to
Ubuntu 20. If it doesn't work, you can always use
[AppImage or Flatpack version of LibreWolf](/installation/linux/).
