<ChangeOs />

### Manual way

Create the `/etc/portage/repos.conf/librewolf.conf` file as follows:

```
[librewolf]
priority = 50
location = <repo-location>/librewolf
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/gentoo.git
auto-sync = Yes
```

Change `repo-location` to a path of your choosing and then run `emaint -r librewolf sync`, Portage should now find and update the repository.

### Eselect way

On terminal:

```bash
sudo eselect repository add librewolf git https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/gentoo.git
```

And then run `emaint -r librewolf sync`, Portage should now find and update the repository.
