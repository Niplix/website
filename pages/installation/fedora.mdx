The prefered way to install on Fedora right now are the releases built on the
_Fedora COPR_ by bgstack. The release page for that is:
[download here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bgstack15/AfterMozilla/).
Here is how to enable copr and install LibreWolf with `dnf`:

```
dnf copr enable bgstack15/AfterMozilla
dnf install librewolf
```

You can also now download and install the latest `fresh` `.rpm` below

<FreshDownloadButton endsWith=".fc35.x86_64.rpm" />

'[Fresh](https://fresh.librewolf.io/)' also has a version for Fedora 34
available.
