<InstallationHeader />

We have a fedora repository available with which you can install LibreWolf. You
can add it to your system and install LibreWolf by running the following
commands one by one:

```bash
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.librewolf.net/librewolf-repo.repo

sudo dnf install librewolf
```

You should accept any prompts wanting to import the GPG key with the fingerprint
`034F7776EF5E0C613D2F7934D29FBD5F93C0CFC3`.

## COPR (unofficial)

Another good installation source on Fedora right now are the independent and
unofficial releases built on the _Fedora COPR_ by bgstack. The release page for
that is [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bgstack15/AfterMozilla/).
Here is how to enable copr and install LibreWolf with `dnf`:

```bash
dnf copr enable bgstack15/AfterMozilla

dnf install librewolf
```
