LibreWolf for Arch Linux can be downloaded from the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository).
There there are two packages,
[`librewolf`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/librewolf)
and [`librewolf-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/librewolf-bin).
The first one compiles Librewolf from the Firefox source
code with our patches and modifications while the second one provides
a binary.

### With [`yay`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/)

```bash
yay -S librewolf
```

or alternatively

```bash
yay -S librewolf-bin
```

### Without an AUR helper

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/librewolf-bin.git librewolf
cd librewolf
makepkg -si
```

  **Note** The since the `librewolf` version compiles the whole browser from
  source, the installation will take a long time. For a fast installation,
  `librewolf-bin` is recommended.
