## Compiling from source

Instructions for building LibreWolf from source on macOS can be found
[in the build guide](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/macos/-/blob/master/build_guide.md).
This method is strongly suggested, especially on M1 powered machines, where the
compile time is rather short.
